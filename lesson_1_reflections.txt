How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

First of all, the basic structure of the code was available.

So, we were able to find out quickly where the changes occured as most of the code will be same as the previous version.

By spotting the anomalies of the structure of code in both the versions, it gives us a broader view as to which part actually is contributing towards the change.

How Could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Once again, i would quote the same thing, having access to the previous structure provides us with the ground work that the program has been built upon and we get a headstart to troubleshoot the errors and carry out the upgradation task.
